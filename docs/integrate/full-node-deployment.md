Steps in this guide involve waiting for the Heimdall and Bor services to fully sync. This process takes several days to complete.

Alternatively, you can use a maintained snapshot, which will reduce the sync time to a few hours. For detailed instructions, see [Snapshot Instructions for Heimdall and Bor](https://forum.matic.network/t/snapshot-instructions-for-heimdall-and-bor/2278).

For snapshot download links, see [Polygon Chains Snapshots](https://snapshots.matic.today/).

# Full Node Deployment (Mumbai testnet)

We have created simple Ansible playbooks to setup a full node.

## Prerequisites

- Two machines — one local machine on which you will run the Ansible playbook; one remote machine — for Full Node.
- On the local machine, Ansible installed.
- On the local machine, Python 3.x installed.
- On the remote machine, make sure Go is not installed.
- On the remote machine, your local machine's SSH public key is on the remote machine to let Ansible connect to them.


## Overview

- To get to a running full node, do the following:
- Have the two machines prepared.
- Set up a Full Node through Ansible.
- Configure the Full node.
- Start the Full node.
- Check node health with the community.

:::note
You must follow the exact outlined sequence of actions, otherwise you will run into issues.
:::

<!-- ## Pre-requisite

- Install **Ansible with Python 3.x**: Ansible should be installed on local machine with **Python3.x**. The setup will not work if you have Python2.x.
    - To install ansible with Python 3.x you can use this command `pip3 install ansible`. This will install Python 3 dependencies as well as ansible.
- Check [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#requirements](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#requirements) for requirements
- You will also need to make sure that **Go is not installed on your VM / Machine**. Setting up your full node through ansible will run into issues if you have Go already installed, as ansible requires specific packages of Go to be installed.
- You will also need to make sure that your VM / Machine **does not have any previous setups for Matic Validator or Heimdall or Bor**. You will need to delete them as your setup will run into issues. -->

## Setup full node for Testnetv4/Mumbai testnet

- Ensure you have access to the remote machine or VM that the full node is being setup on. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup) for more details.
- Clone the [`https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible`](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible) repo

- ```sh
    cd node-ansible
    ```

- Edit the `inventory.yml` file and insert your IP(s) in the `sentry->hosts` section. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory) for more details.
- Check if remote machine is reachable by running

    ```js
    ansible sentry -m ping
    ```

- For a test run to confirm if the correct remote machine / VM is configured, run the following command:

    ```js
    ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.14-beta2 heimdall_branch=v0.2.8 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry heimdall_network=mumbai" --list-hosts
    ```

    This will be the output

    ```sh
    playbook: playbooks/network.yml
    pattern: ['all']
    host (1):
        xx.xxx.x.xxx
    ```

- Setup the full node with this command:

    ```js
    ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.14-beta2 heimdall_branch=v0.2.8 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry heimdall_network=mumbai"
    ```

- In case you run into any issues, delete and clean the whole setup using

    ```js
    ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/clean.yml
    ```

- Login to the remote machine
- Open for editing `vi ~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml`:
    ```js
    moniker=<enter unique identifier>
    ```

    ```js
    seeds="4cd60c1d76e44b05f7dfd8bab3f447b119e87042@54.147.31.250:26656"
    ```

Incase your Heimdall has stopped syncing you can add additional seeds to your `config.toml` file:

```js
 seeds="4cd60c1d76e44b05f7dfd8bab3f447b119e87042@54.147.31.250:26656,b18bbe1f3d8576f4b73d9b18976e71c65e839149@34.226.134.117:26656"
```
- Open for editing `vi ~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml`:

    ```js
    eth_rpc_url =<insert Infura or any full node RPC URL to Goerli>
    ```

- Add the following flag in `vi ~/node/bor/start.sh` to the `bor` start params:

```bash
--bootnodes "enode://320553cda00dfc003f499a3ce9598029f364fbb3ed1222fdc20a94d97dcc4d8ba0cd0bfa996579dcc6d17a534741fb0a5da303a90579431259150de66b597251@54.147.31.250:30303"
```

In case your Bor node has stopped syncing, you can add additional bootnodes to your `start.sh` file:

```js
--bootnodes enode://320553cda00dfc003f499a3ce9598029f364fbb3ed1222fdc20a94d97dcc4d8ba0cd0bfa996579dcc6d17a534741fb0a5da303a90579431259150de66b597251@54.147.31.250:30303,enode://f0f48a8781629f95ff02606081e6e43e4aebd503f3d07fc931fad7dd5ca1ba52bd849a6f6c3be0e375cf13c9ae04d859c4a9ae3546dc8ed4f10aa5dbb47d4998@34.226.134.117:30303
```

:::note
 In case you want to turn `trace` on for Bor, add the following flag to the `bor` start params in `~/node/bor/start.sh`:
    - `--gcmode 'archive'`
:::

## Start nodes and services

- Run the full node with the following commands:
    - **To Start Heimdall**:

    ```js
    sudo service heimdalld start
    ```

    - **To start Heimdall Rest Server you can run the following command**:

    ```js
    sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start
    ```

    Once Heimdall is synced, run the following command:

    ```js
    sudo service bor start
    ```

- Check logs:
    - **Check Heimdall logs:**
    ```js
    journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f
    ```

    - **Check Heimdall Rest Server logs**
    ```js
    journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f
    ```

    - **Check Bor logs**
    ```js
    journalctl -u bor.service -f
    ```

- To check if Heimdall is synced
    - On the remote machine/VM, run `curl localhost:26657/status`
    - In the output, `catching_up` value should be `false`

- Ports / Firewall configuration
    - Open ports 22, 26656 and 30303 to world (0.0.0.0/0) on node firewall. All other ports should be closed.

- Open for editing `vi ~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml`.

    In `heimdall-config.toml`, change the following:

    * `eth_rpc_url` — an RPC endpoint for a fully synced Ethereum mainnet node, i.e Infura. `eth_rpc_url =<insert Infura or any full node RPC URL to Ethereum>`

    Example: `eth_rpc_url = "https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/60f2a23810ba11c827d3da642802412a"`

## Start the Heimdall Service

The latest version, [Heimdall v.0.2.8](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v0.2.8), contains few enhancements such as **restricting data size in state sync txs** to:
* **30Kb** when represented in **bytes**
* **60Kb** when represented as **string**.

For example:

```
Data - "abcd1234"
Length in string format - 8
Hex Byte representation - [171 205 18 52]
Length in byte format - 4
```

- Run the full node with the following commands:
    - **To Start Heimdall**:

    ```js
    sudo service heimdalld start
    ```

    - **To start Heimdall Rest Server you can run the following command**:

    ```js
    sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start
    ```

    Once Heimdall is synced, run the following command:

    ```js
    sudo service bor start
    ```
- Check logs:
    - **Check Heimdall logs:**
    ```js
    journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f
    ```

    - **Check Heimdall Rest Server logs**
    ```js
    journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f
    ```

    - **Check Bor logs**
    ```js
    journalctl -u bor.service -f
    ```

- Ports / Firewall configuration
    - Open ports 22, 26656 and 30303 to world (0.0.0.0/0) on node firewall. All other ports should be closed.
